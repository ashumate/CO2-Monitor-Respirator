# CO2-Monitor-Respirator

This is a respirator setup that I made after some coments online that while sites like Etsy have very stylish 'cyberpunk' respirators, none are very functional. This is the first iteration, with future ones planned.

What you'll need to recreate this version

1. A Dentec Comfort-Air NX respirator
2. These items from Adafruit (need to add link)
3. The STLs in this repo printed
4. The custom version of circuitpython from this repo

Once you've gathered everything together,



If you want to make changes to the mounting plate, you can access the original in TinkerCad, just dupicate it and modify to your heart's content https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aItuTWLHWLe-co2-monitor-respirator-mounting-plate
